# Project Proposal
## For my project, I'm kinda torn between two things. I either just want to make a simple interactive art piece where a person can just move their move and make something move on screen, or make a simple game similiar to pong. I feel like with my coding abilities both of those ideas would be very good for me to do. I perfer to work alone, but if there is someone who would like to work on something like my idea then I would like to work with them.
